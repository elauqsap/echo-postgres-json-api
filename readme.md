## Example RESTful JSON API in Go

#### Backstory
A recent project of mine required me to develop a JSON API. Since Go is my current language of choice I decided to use it in building the API. I first set out to find some example apps or boilerplates. However, with Go being the language that it is I didn't find anything that stood out to me. I begun researching and this semi boilerplate of an example demonstrates a few of the tricks I learned.
